# How to create a pull request?

# What is a pull request?
<code> Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. 
  When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.</code> <br>

**Step 2 :-**  <code>Now Change code or add code on your personal copy repository </code> <br>

**Step 3 :-**  <code>On your copy repo,sitpry click Pull Requests and raise a Pull Request selecting your fork on the right drop down</code> <br>
